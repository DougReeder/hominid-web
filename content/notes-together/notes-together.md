Do you struggle to remember what was discussed at the meetup in February or the staff meeting last Tuesday?
Did you learn something at the conference in Columbus that's only relevant now?
Have you taken notes on an important topic, and can't find them?
*Notes Together* can help!
Just search for any words in your note, then skim the list by date.

Quickly capture info on your phone, using voice dictation or the camera, regardless if you have a data connection.
[RemoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io/) automatically syncs your data between devices when your device is back online.
Or, use system share to pass in URLs, text and files. (Requires Notes Together to be installed.)
Review notes on your personal computer, and clean them up if you like.
RemoteStorage keeps you in control of your data - you're never locked into one storage provider.
