I attended the Newton track of Apple's World Wide
Development Conference today. (WWDC continues until Friday)

The Development Overview session was a reasonable
introduction to the Newton Tool Kit environment. The
Building Newton Solutions session focused on four or five
applications for specific markets. One was a program for the
State of California's disaster evaluation. The user filled
out a form using popup menus, lists and so forth, got the
location from an attached GPS unit, and could sketch the
scene. Another was for farmers and talked to a Windows
database. Monsato had started the project three years ago,
found interest by farmers in having information in the
field, but no interest in using laptops PC's on truck
dashboards. The PIE pioneers program will be restructured
at the end of the summer.

I skipped the Newton Communication Wired & Wireless session
and the Bookmaker session to take advantage of the
debugging lab, where the Apple engineer fixed one bug in our
application and identified what needed to be done for
another.

The synchronization session was very interesting,
identifying various levels of ease of use. Users were
classified as using the Newton as either a lunch box, a
credit card, or a collector. PIE's strategy involves PIE
doing the enabling work to allow third party developers to
develop communications software. "Code less, ship more"
Newton Connection is considered a first generation product,
and they are moving toward toolboxes and API's for direct
Mac & Windows application communication. Integration
Libraries will be available sometime during the summer to
allow developers to produce Mac files from the synch files.
Newton Connection for Developers was announced, which has a
Listener window similar to the Inspector window in NTK to
allow debugging of Meta Datas. It has been seeded to some
developers and will come out this summer.

The feedback forum was lively, with developers stating their
desires and the PIE DTS people giving an idea how soon
various upgrades and interfaces will be available. The
compiler is still under development. One fellow complained
that there was no solution for the 30 app barrier that
worked on original MessagePad's, but another member of the
audience said he had one in hand. Most of the concerns
expressed here were addressed and a number of others besides.


Some notable facts I gathered:




* Transparent 110's were for sale, and a number of Apple people
	had them.
* Application storage fills up separately from frames storage
	(used by running applications). The division between these
	two domains is fixed.
* Running applications from Flash RAM cards or static RAM
	cards is not noticeably slower than running from main
	memory.
* Don't use full justification in print formats, it's broken.
* No Newton on a Mac any time soon.
* TCP-IP is 6-12 months away
* There will probably be a Newton Development conference in
	the fall.
* The Alpha draft of the Human Interface guidelines has been
	posted to various sources.
* There is hope of support for application deletion, as
	distinct the RemoveScript, so applications that are being
	deleted (not just having their card removed) can deleted
	their soups, etc.




Don't take any of this as gospel, I'm just typing this out
quickly.

So, overall, nothing earth-shattering, but the development
environment is maturing and more and more applications are
coming out.

I used a MP100 to gather notes, and looking back, my note
gathering was rather inefficient in gathering information
and spending time wisely. I didn't waste any time pawing
through paper notes to find the one I wanted, but I lost
more time trying to get notes into the Newton. However, I
did get answers to almost all of my questions because I had
a To Do list of them on hand. I exchanged electronic
business cards with about two dozen people, and that was
nice because I have the information in a usable database.
It was also quite useful to be able to show off the
applications I'm working on. The Newton was also a great
way to kill time and accomplish modest amounts of work while
traveling. I killed a half hour in the San Jose airport
entering the data from the two paper business cards I
received. This echoes the direction that many developers
are taking, limiting the amount of written input necessary
to use the program.

For the next conference, I suggest speakers have their
lecture outline available for downloading, by beaming or
otherwise. If I had the outline as a base, I could have
added comments and extensions and ended up with decent
notes. Text editing is much more feasible on the Newton than
primary text entering.
