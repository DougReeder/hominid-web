While constructing a chest based on the Mästermyr find, I have noticed
several odd features. The bottom fits into a dado on the ends, which
extend downward to form the feet, and is also mortised into the ends,
so weight on the bottom of the chest is transmitted to the ends (not
odd).

1. The chest is 90” long, but only 28” wide, so the bottom, only
3/4” thick, could use some support from the sides to enhance its
rigidity. However, the sides have rabbets, which decrease the
thickness of wood for the pegs which hold it together, and means the
sides rest partly on the bottom.
2. The sides are cut in such a way that they rest partly on the ends,
which makes the chest more complicated and the tolerances much more
finicky.
3. The top is carved as a shallow barrel arch, which is more work than
the whole rest of the chest and decreases the utility of the chest as
a work surface and makes it harder to stack.

The one thing these three design points do enhance is the ability of
the chest to carry weight on top of the lid, at some expense to the
ability of the chest to carry weight inside. Also, the chest is long
enough for two adults to sit on.

The majority of the half-dozen chests depicted in [_From Viking to Crusader_]
are similarly long and narrow, with curved tops. I don’t know if they
share the other design characteristics of the Mastermyr chest as well.

From this, I conclude that many, if not most, chests were designed to function well as seats.
This may go some way toward explaining the paucity of chairs and stools discovered.
