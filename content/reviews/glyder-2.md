Extremely immersive despite small screen! The interface almost disappears! A tranquil action game.
Could use some FAQs such as how to land on a platform, how to unlock other areas.
Worth a lot more than $3!

The improved graphics of the "HD" version for the HP Touchpad tablet make it even better.

Ported from iOS, where its predecessor _Glyder_ is also available.
