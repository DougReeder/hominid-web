"Scanners Live in Vain" burst on the SF scene in 1951, when Frederik Pohl anthologised it a year after its initial publication.
The first published story of Paul M. A. Linebarger, writing as Cordwainer Smith, was so good that it was widely thought that Cordwainer Smith was a new pseudonym for an accomplished author.

“Scanners” have their nerves severed and then go through long training, to achieve feats impossible to ordinary humans: standing the unendurable pain of space, pilot spaceships for months without sleep, and move at super-speed when required.
Their lack of empathy *follows* from the mechanism of their powers.
They form a small fraternity that is treated with as an equal by the power that rules known space.

~~The story shows their intellectualism leads them to narrow-mindedness and hubris.~~

Twentieth-century SF fandom was overwhelmingly white young males with an intellectual bent.
They identified with heroes who prevailed by their intellect, though only a minority asserted [“Fans are *Slan*”](../slan-van-vogt/).
I suspect few fans wanted to *be* Scanners, but they certainly would have respected and envied their power.
Linebarger was a professor of East Asian studies before and after WW2, and an Army psychological warfare expert during.
His take on this powerful elite is more nuanced than most fans.

We see only a single event of the Scanners. They appear fixed.  But that is their nature — robotic, unfeeling. They are almost all alike.
But that is their role in the story; their inflexibility is their flaw.

In the story, when their monopoly on interplanetary travel is threatened by a new innovation, they react with jealousy disguised as concern for society. They vote to murder the innovator — a direct violation of their pact with the Instrumentality.
The story suggests the scanners were needed at one point, but no longer are.
And the mechanism that gives them power makes them not see their failings.

~~The story ends hopefully — humans no longer need endure a cruel mutilation of body and spirit to travel the galaxy.~~




Writing after 1977, there's a comparison to be made with the Jedi, who renounce emotion and human connection to *obtain* their powers.
Past Star Wars works have sometimes questioned whether the Jedi were as effective or good as they claimed to be.
*The Acolyte* makes those questions its focus.
We see Jedi arrogantly presuming they have the only ethical way to use The Force, make stupid mistakes that cost lives, and repeatedly cover up their mistakes with lies.

At least one Senator of the Galactic Republic openly questions whether the Jedi deserve their special status.

Over its 240 minutes, we see a variety of Jedi, from the earnest young Padawan Jecki through the experienced Master Sol, who has made a few key mistakes over his career, to the senior Vernestra who focuses on control of the damage to the Jedi's reputation, often resorting to lying and slander.
We see a living organization.
Sol presumably has had many adventures, and his demeanor suggests he tried to do right.
But, sixteen years ago Sol and three other Jedi agreed to conceal the failures of their mission.
And one wonders what Verestra has been dealing with, to make her so reflexively reach for falsehoods?
If the Jedi in this series are representative, ~~the surprise is not that they were wiped out a century on —~~ the surprise is that they didn't collapse sooner.
