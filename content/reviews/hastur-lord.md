review copyright © 2010 by P. Douglas Reeder

There are several excellent Darkover novels, and the series was at one time my favorite. While they have aged better than many books of the ’60s and ’70s, they have not always held up under re-reading.

Hastur Lord takes up some of Bradley’s best characters ten years after _The Year of the World-Wreckers_.

The Darkover books were at one time my favorite series.
