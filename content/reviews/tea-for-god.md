Uses non-euclidean geometry so the character traverses a huge space, while the player walks around their physical space. Excellent concept, very immersive. Manages to be both claustrophobic and spacious!

Controls and weapons need a bit more documentation, and it would be good to have more indication of progress. It’s shaping up to be a landmark game.

4/5
