Review © 2021 Doug Reeder

Not my usual, but I can tell a good novel when I see it.

A Post-modern (the characters know they are in a fairy-tale), but not fractured, fairy-tale, but thankfully the narrative is linear.

The unicorn is the viewpoint character, until she meets Schmendrick the inept magician (a forerunner of Rincewind).

Artfully re-arranges several of the standard fairy-tale tropes, including the Hero and the Damsel in Distress.

As depressing as Donaldson, but shorter.
