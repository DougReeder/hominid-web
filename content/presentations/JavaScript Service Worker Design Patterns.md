abstract: JavaScript Service Workers are a client-side programmable proxy. They operate in a separate thread and can transform data from the network. They can make existing apps more resilient to network latency and bandwidth. Together with technologies like Indexed DB, they allow new architectures, such as local-first apps that always operate on local data, with that data synced when the network is available.  They enable server push and notifications when a web app has no tab open. Together with App Manifest they allow webapps to be installed like native apps.
