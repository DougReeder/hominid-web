						Please read this license agreement. Using the
						SOFTWARE indicates that
						you accept these terms.
</p>
					<p>
						GRANT OF LICENSE: HOMINID grants you the
						nonexclusive right to use the SOFTWARE on one or more devices.
</p>
					<p>
						COPYRIGHT: The SOFTWARE is owned by HOMINID and is protected by
						United
						States

						other purpose. You may not copy the written
						materials accompanying
						the SOFTWARE, make alterations or
						modifications to the SOFTWARE, or
						attempt to discover the source
						code of the SOFTWARE. The SOFTWARE
						may
						not be sublicensed, rented,
						leased. Both the license and your right
						to use the SOFTWARE
						terminate automatically if you violate any
						part
						of this agreement.
						You may not disassemble, decompile or otherwise
						reverse-engineer
						the SOFTWARE in any manner or otherwise attempt
						to
						learn the inner
						workings, source code, structure, algorithms, or

</p>
					<p>
						TERMINATION: This license is effective until terminated. You may

						IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
						MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
						PURPOSE AND ANY
						WARRANTY
						AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE

						WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN

						investment, or the like). Some
						states do not allow the limitation
						and/or exclusion of liability
						for
						incidental or consequential
						damages, so the above limitation or
