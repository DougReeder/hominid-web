					Whether you plan and work top down, bottom up, or inside-out, Outline Tracker works with you.

                    </ul>


					<h3>Where's the Inbox?</h3>
					<p>The webOS Email, Messaging and Phone applications are inboxes, and you probably have others as well.</p>
					<p>
					You can type a new item into <a href='just_type.html'><strong>Just Type</strong></a>, or copy a whole message from another application and paste it in.  From <strong>Quick Actions</strong> select <strong>New Item</strong>.
					(You may need to use the Just Type Preferences to add Outline Tracker's <strong>New Item</strong> command.)
					Outline Tracker will split your text into summary and content text, and search the first part of the text for a due date.
					</p>
					<p>You can quickly create a new item that's similar to an old item by selecting the old item and tapping the New Sibling button: <img src='images/new-sibling.png' align='top'></p>

					<h3>How do I set the Context for a task?</h3>
					<p>Set the Place.  Places don't need to be physical locations.</p>


					<hr />

<div class='palm-body-title'>Daily Review</div>
<div class='palm-body-text'>As part of your daily review, check the webOS Calendar for today, to see appointments and deadlines.</div>
<div class='palm-body-text'>Calendar entries for today can also be seen by selecting <strong>Agenda</strong> in Exhibition Mode. (Exhibition Mode starts when a webOS 2 or 3 device is asleep on a Touchstone.)</div>
<div id='launchCalendarBtn' x-mojo-element='Button'></div>

<div class='palm-body-text'>Review the Tasks in the <strong>To-Do</strong> scene, with Place set to “All Places”.
Tasks with a Lead Time that starts today (including Repeating Tasks) will automatically appear.</div>
<div class='palm-body-text'>If any listed Tasks have been completed, check them off and select “All Places” again, to refresh the list.</div>

<div class='palm-body-text'>If a Task is listed that you <em>couldn't</em> work on today, ask “Why?”.
If it's actually a goal or sub-project, determine what the next step is, and create a child Task (prerequisite).
If the Task is someone else's responsibility, open the Details scene and set <strong>Responsible</strong>, to move the task to the <strong>Waiting</strong> scene.
If you're waiting for someone to do something first, create a child Task and set <strong>Responsible</strong>.
If it's a just a matter of time before you could work on it, open the Details scene and set Lead Time (and Due Date, if that's not ON).
To put a task “on hold” indefinitely, open the Details scene and change it to a Note.
</div>
<div id='toDoBtn' x-mojo-element='Button'></div>

<div class='palm-body-title'>Weekly Review</div>
<div class='palm-body-text'>At least weekly, you should review the Tasks in the <strong>Waiting</strong> scene.
You may need to contact someone about the Tasks he or she is Responsible for.
(He or she can see his or her tasks in Basecamp Classic projects, but not in Local projects.)
Tap his or her name in the <strong>Waiting</strong> scene, then tap his or her phone number, e-mail address, or messaging address.</div>
<div class='palm-body-text'>If any listed Tasks have been completed, check them off and re-select the <strong>Waiting</strong> scene, so parent tasks can appear.</div>
<div id='waitingBtn' x-mojo-element='Button'></div>
<div class='palm-body-text'>To quickly review a Project, use the <strong>To-Do &amp; Future</strong> scene.  This shows all your incomplete Tasks.</div>
<div id='toDoFutureBtn' x-mojo-element='Button'></div>
<div class='palm-body-text'>
For an in-depth review, open the outline scene for the project and use the <strong>Show Incomplete Tasks</strong> command.
This shows the structure of the Project, and also displays incomplete Tasks that others are Responsible for.
Notes and completed Tasks can also be accessed.</div>
<div class='palm-body-text'>Tasks and projects that are no longer relevant should be deleted.</div>

<div class='palm-body-title'>Backups</div>
<div class='palm-body-text'>Every week, you should use the <strong>Backup via E-Mail</strong> command, or (under webOS 2 or 3) put your device in USB mode and copy the latest nightly backup from the “outlines” folder to your desktop computer.
If your device is lost or stolen, backup files on the device are of little use!</div>
<div class='palm-body-text'>Creating a repeating weekly Task for this would be no bad idea. :-)</div>


					<hr />
					<h2 id='mimickingPriorities'>Mimicking Priorities</h2>
					<p>In Local projects, it is possible to use the Responsible field to mimic three levels of priority.
					Set Responsible as “me” for highest priority, “my organization” as middle priority, and “no one” as lowest priority.
					You could even set Responsible to “select from Contacts” as an even lower priority, at the expense of making the Waiting scene useless.
					</p>
					<p>Re-ordering Tasks in outline scenes will affect the order in To-Do scenes.</p>

					<h2 id='generalReccomendations'>General Reccomendations</h2>
					<h3>New Tasks</h3>
					<p>Many things could trigger creating a new Task: a phone call, an email, working on something else.
					It's usually worthwhile to create a Task in the right place in your outline.
					If it's a sibling to a Task in a task scene, select the sibling then tap the New Sibling button: <img src='images/new-sibling.png' align='absmiddle'>
					If it's a prerequisite to a Task in a task scene, select the parent then tap the New Child button: <img src='images/new-child.png' align='absmiddle'>
					Otherwise, tap either the New Sibling or New Child button.
					In the Details scene, tap the <strong>PARENT</strong> selector and select the appropriate parent from the list of Favorite Parents, or select “Select from all...” to choose any item as the parent.
					</p>
					<p>You can copy and paste text from an e-mail, message or web page.  The content text field is a good place to put this.</p>
					<p>If you have a minute, details like Place, Responsible, Due Date and Lead Time can be filled in right away.
					If you're in the middle of something, you can edit the details when you next check a task scene for the next task to work on.</p>

					<h3>Managing Projects and Goals</h3>
					<p>When you first create a project (or a goal within a project), you don't need a complete plan with all the Tasks.
					Just enter the Tasks on your mind.
					As you work on a project or goal, you may find that other Tasks need to be done first.
					Create them as children of existing tasks (prerequisities).
					The <strong>To-Do</strong> scenes will update to show that you can work on the prerequisite, but not its parent.</p>
					<p>If you need a complete plan, for a presentation, or to prepare a budget, enter everything into the outline.
					(You may find it useful to Export the Project so you can view it on a larger screen, or print it out.)
					The <strong>To-Do &amp; Future</strong> scene shows all the undone Tasks, including Tasks with undone prerequisites,
						while the <strong>To-Do &amp; Waiting</strong> scene shows the actionable Tasks for everyone.</p>

					<h3>Meetings</h3>
					<p>It's useful to switch to the <strong>Waiting</strong> scene for meetings -- you can see at a glance who should be working on what.
					The <strong>To-Do &amp; Waiting</strong> scene is also useful, to see actionable tasks for everone on a project.</p>

					<h3>Working with Dates</h3>
					<p>
					A Task you could work on right away, and has no deadline, should set <em>Due Date</em> to off.
						It will show up in task scenes right away and never be flagged overdue.
					A Task you could work on right away, and has a deadline, should have Due Date set to the deadline, and Lead Time set to “unlimited”.
					A Task you can't work on yet, and has a deadline, should have Due Date set to the deadline, and Lead Time set to some appropriate value.
					A Task you can't work on yet, and has no deadline, should have Due Date set to a year after the start date, and Lead Time set to “1 year”.
					(Formally, this is not correct.  But if you haven't made time to complete the Task in a year, you should reconsider how important it is to you.)
					</p>
					<p>If an item has a time as well as a date, you can set the Duration -- but that only affects how the item is displayed in the Calendar app.</p>
					<p>Your calendar should reflect the "hard landscape" of your life -- only the things that <em>must</em> be done on a day should appear there.
					That's why Tasks are only displayed in the Calendar if they're still undone on their due date.
					(If your top-level Tasks represent mileposts, you can change the Preferences to see completed top-level Tasks in the Calendar.
					Lower-level Tasks, too, if that's how you work.)</p>
